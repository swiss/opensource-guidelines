The **official and binding versions** are available in all official languages on the [Swiss Federal Chancellery website](https://www.bk.admin.ch/bk/de/home/digitale-transformation-ikt-lenkung/bundesarchitektur/open_source_software/hilfsmittel_oss.html).

## Legal obligations and responsibility

As outlined in [Article 9 EMOTA](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2023/682/de#art_9), the Federal Administration is **principally obligated to publish its software as open source.** Each federal authority holds independent responsibility for ensuring compliance, including making the source code publicly available.


## Contributing

3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)

## Changes

When **major changes** are proposed, they undergo the Federal Chancellery’s standard review process and, upon approval, are translated and published on the [Swiss Federal Chancellery website](https://www.bk.admin.ch/bk/de/home/digitale-transformation-ikt-lenkung/bundesarchitektur/open_source_software/hilfsmittel_oss.html). The respective documents are then assigned a new version number. 

**Minor changes** are incorporated regularly into the official PDF publications on the [Swiss Federal Chancellery website](https://www.bk.admin.ch/bk/de/home/digitale-transformation-ikt-lenkung/bundesarchitektur/open_source_software/hilfsmittel_oss.html).
