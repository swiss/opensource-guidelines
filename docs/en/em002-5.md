**Publication of Open Source Software (OSS) by the Federal
Administration**

**The new *Federal Act on the Use of Electronic Means to Carry Out
Official Tasks* (EMOTA) came into force on 1 January 2024. It stipulates
that federal authorities must publish the source code of software they
develop or commission. Exceptions are made where third-party rights or
security-relevant reasons preclude or restrict publication.**

**Open source means:**

  - The source code of software is published and is viewable by all
    interested parties.

  - Anyone can use, further develop and distribute the software.
    According to the principle of 'public money, public code', no
    licence fees are charged.

  - Multiple organisations can use the software and jointly develop it
    further.

**Open source does not mean:**

  - That data managed with the application becomes publicly accessible.

  - That you lose control of your application. You decide for yourself
    under which licence software is published, whether you adopt
    third-party modifications and when you install new versions of the
    software.

  - That a community automatically emerges and the application is used
    by others.

**Procedure in the Federal Administration:**

  - Each federal authority, i.e. each office or organisational unit, is
    itself responsible for implementing Art. 9 EMOTA and publishing the
    software.

  - The law applies to all software developed after 1 January 2024.

  - For external procurement, the amended FOBL specifications must be
    adhered to.
